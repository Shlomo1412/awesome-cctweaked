# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! Please follow these instructions to ensure consistency and proper crediting:

1. **Always put credits to the creator.** If the project is a recreation of an old one, you must credit the original project and author as well.

2. **Try using the project's original description.** If not present, confusing, or not matching the repository theme, you can write your own description. Make it clear and follow the repo's theme.

3. **If you're using the project's original description and adding notes by yourself, surround your notes with asterisks (*like this*).**

4. **Put badges after the description.** If you are not sure how to make one, you can try the Shieldy website: https://shlomo1412.github.io/shieldy-site/.

5. **Credit yourself in the `### Contributors` section.**

6. **Projects for ComputerCraft (that don't support modern CC: Tweaked) are not allowed.**

7 **You can't add yourself as an awesome person**.

Thank you for helping keep this list awesome and consistent!
