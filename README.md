> A comprehensive web-based development suite for **CC: Tweaked** by [Shlomo1412](https://github.com/Shlomo1412). This project provides a toolset to streamline ComputerCraft application development.



**XCC** includes UI generator with support for multiple UI frameworks ([Basalt](https://basalt.madefor.cc/), [PixelUI](https://shlomo1412.github.io/pixelui-website/), and [PrimeUI](https://mcjack123.github.io/PrimeUI/)), advanced components like `TreeView` and `Chart` widgets, and a dedicated NFP picture editor. The toolset generates clean, production-ready `Lua`/`XML`/`JSON`/`XCC` code and supports project management through our custom `.xcc` file format.

**The project is now available as an open-source solution for CC: Tweaked developers.**

As always, feedback is welcome. Feel free to point out bugs, open issues, and suggest a feature/new tool.

### Current Tools:
